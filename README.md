### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Reverse traps are the least gay because they play with the elements of masculinity with still their true femininity still shines clear.

This requires inherently strong femininity, that hidden under a masculine veneer (yet subtly accentuated in its contrast) they still have a sexual energy akin to a lesser girl forced to emphasize basic surface femininity to extend her own limited femininity.

The fact is, girl-boys are more girly than girl-girls. So if you like girly girls, youâ€™re gay, but youâ€™re still not as straight as liking girl-boys!
